# Mixed Messages - Pokemon

This project is my submission for Codecademy's Mixed Message challenge. It generates a message with a random Pokemon encounter, including the Pokemon's level, shiny status, and IVs.

The original instructions were to create a script that generates a random message each time it is run.

his project allowed me to practice:

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Displaying logs into the console
- Randomization logic

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the project onto your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is stored.
3. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

The program will then output a random pokemon!

## Project Status

I'd like to continue expanding upon this project in the future. As it stands this is an MVP to fulfill the project requirements on codecademy.

> Future Plans below will potentially be expanded upon if worth the investment.

### Future Plans:

- Connect script to a live page with functioning buttons
- Display images correlating to the pokemon caught
- Deploy live site
- Add more pokemon
- Continue expanding upon logic to contain more data for the pokemon
- Potentially add a rudimentary battle system using the generated pokemon
- Store data locally
